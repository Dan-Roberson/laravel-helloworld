## Laravel-HelloWorld:
I copied some of this out of this: https://github.com/niwasawa/php-laravel-hello-world.git  but then customized it to explore Laravel.

Initial thoughts:
Seems like a great framework that's relatively easy to navigate.  One thing I don't like is that controllers are referenced as a string when defining the routes.  That was a little confusing for me, but I think it'll just take some time to get used to it.
